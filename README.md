# phaser-bomberman

Not finished, development in progress in moments when I feel interested to work on it :)

This is pixel perfect (+-, but I tried to do it) copy of Bomberman II game written on Phaser.js.


To run the game use Node.js 16, starting from Node v17 the game doesn't work.

Run:

```
// Warning: use Node.js <= v16. This project doesn't work on Node.js starting from v17
$ git clone https://github.com/airs0urce/phaser-bomberman.git
$ cd phaser-bomberman
$ npm ci
$ npm start

```

Move character - arrow keys  
Place a bomb - A key

If you want to play with somebody you can connect two USB gamepads (for example I used Dualshock 4).
