# phaser-bomberman

Not finished, development in progress in moments when I feel interested to work on it :)

This is pixel perfect (+-, but I tried to do it) copy of Bomberman II game written on Phaser.js.
To run the game, make sure node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/) and run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/airs0urce/phaser-bomberman.git
$ cd phaser-bomberman
$ npm install
$ npm run start

```

Move character - arrow keys  
Place a bomb - A key
